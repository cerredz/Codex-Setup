Create a comprehensive research report on all functionalities and capabilities of OpenClaw. Cover what it can do, how to set it up, how to use it in practice, key workflows, architecture/components if available, limitations, and what makes it unique versus alternatives. Write everything in very easy-to-understand, natural dialogue-style prose with complete sentences. Avoid vague, clipped, or overly short sentences. Be thorough and research-oriented, aiming to capture everything OpenClaw has to offer.

Use this file for optional attached context: claude/reports/run_twice/20260220_182437_create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie/report.txt.
Also keep track of every file updated during implementation in claude/reports/run_twice/20260220_182437_create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie/create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie_updated_files.txt, using one line per file in the format "- path | what changed".
Before finishing this call, overwrite the updated files file so it accurately reflects the implementation work completed in call 1.
