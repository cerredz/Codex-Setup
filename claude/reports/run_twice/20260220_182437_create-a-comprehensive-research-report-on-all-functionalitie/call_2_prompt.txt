Create a comprehensive research report on all functionalities and capabilities of OpenClaw. Cover what it can do, how to set it up, how to use it in practice, key workflows, architecture/components if available, limitations, and what makes it unique versus alternatives. Write everything in very easy-to-understand, natural dialogue-style prose with complete sentences. Avoid vague, clipped, or overly short sentences. Be thorough and research-oriented, aiming to capture everything OpenClaw has to offer.

Use this file for optional attached context: claude/reports/run_twice/20260220_182437_create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie/report.txt.
Use this file as continuation context: claude/reports/run_twice/20260220_182437_create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie/create-a-comprehensive-research-report-on-all-functionalitie_updated_files.txt, which lists files already updated and what was implemented in those files.
Continue from that state instead of starting over, then overwrite the updated files file so it reflects the final combined state after call 2.
