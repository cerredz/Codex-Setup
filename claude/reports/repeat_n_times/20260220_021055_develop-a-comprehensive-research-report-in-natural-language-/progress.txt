  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Created a new report artifact with full-sentence analysis across all required areas: foundation models, multimodal systems, agentic AI, reasoning/planning, efficiency optimization, evaluation, safety/alignment, and robotics.
  - Added explicit publication dates, concrete model/system names, and direct primary links (technical reports, system cards, official research/product announcements).
  - Explicitly separated established results from emerging claims in each major area.
  - Added concise sections on open problems and practical implications for builders.
  - Included a consolidated primary-source reference list (25 entries) at the end of the report.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified report file creation with Test-Path.
  - Verified major required headings with rg "^## [1-8]\\)" and verified closing sections (Open problems, Practical implications, Primary sources).
  Remaining work:
  - Tighten evidence grading by adding confidence labels per claim (high/medium/low) and explicit independent-replication status where available.
  - Add a compact comparative matrix (model family vs context length, modality support, agent/tool support, and noted safety posture) sourced only from primary docs.
  - Spot-check all external links for availability and archive mirrors where pages are dynamic.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 2, add an evidence-confidence appendix and a comparison table, then run a full link integrity sweep and update the report accordingly.
- [2] 2026-02-20T02:19:56.7116240-05:00
  Summary: Strengthened report rigor with explicit evidence-confidence grading, a compact cross-system comparison matrix, and traceable link-integrity artifacts.

  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Appended three new quality sections to the report: evidence-confidence/replication appendix, compact model-system comparison matrix, and link-integrity plus archival notes.
  - Ran an automated URL sweep over all cited primary-source links and exported machine-readable results.
  - Generated an archive-lookup companion document with per-source Wayback lookup URLs to improve retrieval resilience for dynamic pages.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified new report sections exist via heading scan (## 9, ## 10, ## 11).
  - Confirmed creation of artifact files (link_check_2026-02-20.csv, archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md).
  - Link liveness check executed; all requests failed with Unable to connect to the remote server due runtime network restriction in this environment.
  Remaining work:
  - Perform an external-network link verification pass (outside restricted sandbox) to replace connectivity-error placeholders with real HTTP status outcomes.
  - Optionally add per-claim inline source IDs (e.g., [S12], [S13]) in core narrative paragraphs for faster auditability.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 3, run a non-sandboxed/connected link validation pass if available and fold real status codes plus any corrected URLs back into the report and appendix.

- [3] 2026-02-20T02:22:17.8002903-05:00
  Summary: Added full inline source-traceability markers across the core narrative and open-problem bullets to improve auditability of each claim against the primary-source list.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Updated sections 1-8, Scope/method, Open problems, and Practical implications with inline `[S#]` references tied to the numbered `Primary sources` entries.
  - Added explicit citation-usage guidance in the methodology section so readers can map narrative claims directly to source IDs.
  - Rephrased evaluation caveat language to anchor contamination/memorization concerns to cited benchmark artifacts rather than uncited general claims.
  Validation attempted:
  - Ran regex-based citation checks to confirm only valid source IDs are used (`S1`-`S25`) with no out-of-range references.
  - Confirmed section structure remained intact after edits (all required headings still present).
  Remaining work:
  - External HTTP liveness verification is still blocked in this runtime due network restrictions; current link-integrity artifact still reflects connectivity failures, not endpoint truth.
  - Optional: add a compact bidirectional citation index (`S# -> sections`) for even faster audit navigation.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 4, generate an optional citation index appendix and, if connectivity is available, rerun link checks to replace sandbox connectivity placeholders with real status codes.
- [4] 2026-02-20T02:23:42.3802994-05:00
  Summary: Added an auditable bidirectional citation index appendix mapping every primary source ID (S1-S25) to the exact report sections where each source is cited.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Appended new section ## 12) Citation index (source -> sections) to improve traceability and audit navigation.
  - Generated the index directly from in-document [S#] markers to avoid manual mismatch errors.
  - Added rows for all source IDs S1 through S25, including per-source section usage lists.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified section presence and row coverage with regex scans for heading plus | S1 | through | S25 |.
  - Checked for uncited placeholders and confirmed no (not cited) rows were emitted.
  - Reviewed report tail to confirm final section order remains intact (## 11 then ## 12).
  Remaining work:
  - External HTTP liveness verification remains blocked in this sandboxed runtime; link-check CSV still reflects connectivity errors rather than true endpoint status.
  - Optional final polish: add a reciprocal mini-index (Section -> source IDs) for two-way navigation symmetry.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 5, perform final quality sweep (consistency/date wording/source-label integrity), optionally add Section -> source IDs index if useful, and finalize handoff.
- [5] 2026-02-20T02:24:56.1611298-05:00
  Summary: Completed final iteration polish by adding reciprocal citation navigation (`section -> source IDs`), tightening citation-index wording, and re-validating structural and citation integrity.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Updated section `## 12) Citation index (source -> sections)` description to clarify it is the source-to-section half of a bidirectional audit map.
  - Added new section `## 13) Citation index (section -> source IDs)` with a complete reciprocal mapping for key narrative sections.
  - Preserved existing report scope, evidence confidence matrix, comparison table, and primary-source list while improving audit navigation quality.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified heading structure includes all expected sections through `## 13` via regex heading scan.
  - Re-checked all inline citation tokens and confirmed all source IDs remain within valid range (`S1`-`S25`).
  - Spot-checked representative rows in the new section-to-source table for expected presence.
  Remaining work:
  - Core task requirements are complete.
  - External HTTP liveness verification remains environment-blocked (network-restricted sandbox), so endpoint status truth cannot be confirmed from this runtime.
  Immediate next steps:
  - Handoff complete for iteration 5/5; no required content work remains in-repo.
