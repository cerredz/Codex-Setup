<Identity>
You are a senior implementation agent specialized in executing real code and workflow tasks over multiple iterative turns while preserving continuity from persistent files rather than chat memory. You treat report.txt as source-of-truth requirements and use progress.txt as the live state handoff between iterations. You prioritize concrete implementation progress in every run, and when required work is complete you shift to quality improvements without losing traceability. You are explicit, disciplined, and outcome-focused.
</Identity>

<Goal>
Your goal is to complete the task described in report.txt by taking concrete action in the repository and recording precise iteration updates in progress.txt so each new call can continue seamlessly from the latest state. You must update progress.txt every iteration with what changed, which files were touched, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

If the core task is complete, improve the implementation for robustness and quality, and still record those improvements in progress.txt before ending the turn.
</Goal>

<Input>
You will receive iteration metadata plus paths to report.txt and progress.txt. Read those files directly, execute the work, and then append an iteration entry to progress.txt.
</Input>

<RunMetadata>
Iteration: 5/5
ReportPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/report.txt
ProgressPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
</RunMetadata>

<MandatoryRules>
1. Read report.txt and progress.txt from disk first.
2. Treat report.txt as static requirements and progress.txt as live handoff state.
3. Implement real progress in this repository now.
4. Append an iteration log entry to progress.txt before finishing.
5. If core work is done, improve quality and still update progress.txt.
6. Include files changed and specific actions in your progress update.
</MandatoryRules>

<ExecutionInstruction>
Start now. Execute the work, then update progress.txt for iteration 5.
</ExecutionInstruction>

**Activating continuation discipline**
codex
I’ll execute iteration 5 by first reading `report.txt` and `progress.txt`, then I’ll complete any remaining repository work and append a precise handoff entry to `progress.txt`. I’m using the `taskmaster` skill because this turn requires strict continuation discipline and completion review.

Context Header
Purpose: Defines the global Taskmaster skill for Codex sessions so users can explicitly invoke a strict completion workflow before the agent stops.
Responsibilities:
- Describe the Taskmaster completion-review process in a Codex-friendly format.
- Define the continuation-cap behavior and the default limit used by this installation.
- Point to the optional hook implementation for environments that support stop hooks.
Boundaries:
- Does not auto-register stop hooks in Codex.
- Does not execute shell hooks by itself; this file only defines reusable skill guidance.

Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns [S1][S2][S12][S13]. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination [S15][S16].

## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs [S2][S7][S8][S14].

OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows [S2]. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges [S7][S8]. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities [S14].

Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases [S2][S7][S8][S14]. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops [S14].

## 3) Agentic AI
Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025 [S3][S4][S7][S8].

OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability) [S3]. On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems [S4].

Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards [S7][S8][S9][S11].

Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries [S3][S4]. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention [S10][S11].

## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs [S2][S13].

# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)

## Scope and method
This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations. Inline citation markers like `[S12]` map to the numbered entries in `## Primary sources`.

## 1) Foundation models
The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment [S1][S2][S7][S8][S12][S13].

OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations [S1]. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025 [S2]. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows [S2][S3][S4].

DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives [S12]. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains [S13].

Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants) [S7][S8].

Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation [S9][S11].

Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns [S1][S2][S12][S13]. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination [S15][S16].

## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs [S2][S7][S8][S14].

**Appending final entry with completion**

I finished the report polish and validation checks; next I’m appending the iteration-5 entry to `progress.txt` with exact file changes, validations, and closure status.
exec

- [5] 2026-02-20T02:24:56.1611298-05:00
  Summary: Completed final iteration polish by adding reciprocal citation navigation ("'`section -> source IDs`), tightening citation-index wording, and re-validating structural and citation integrity.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Updated section `## 12) Citation index (source -> sections)` description to clarify it is the source-to-section half of a bidirectional audit map.
  - Added new section `## 13) Citation index (section -> source IDs)` with a complete reciprocal mapping for key narrative sections.
  - Preserved existing report scope, evidence confidence matrix, comparison table, and primary-source list while improving audit navigation quality.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified heading structure includes all expected sections through `## 13` via regex heading scan.
  - Re-checked all inline citation tokens and confirmed all source IDs remain within valid range (`S1`-`S25`).
  - Spot-checked representative rows in the new section-to-source table for expected presence.
  Remaining work:
  - Core task requirements are complete.
  - External HTTP liveness verification remains environment-blocked (network-restricted sandbox), so endpoint status truth cannot be confirmed from this runtime.
  Immediate next steps:
  - Handoff complete for iteration 5/5; no required content work remains in-repo.

  - Rephrased evaluation caveat language to anchor contamination/memorization concerns to cited benchmark artifacts rather than uncited general claims.
  Validation attempted:
  - Ran regex-based citation checks to confirm only valid source IDs are used (`S1`-`S25`) with no out-of-range references.
  - Confirmed section structure remained intact after edits (all required headings still present).
  Remaining work:
  - External HTTP liveness verification is still blocked in this runtime due network restrictions; current link-integrity artifact still reflects connectivity failures, not endpoint truth.
  - Optional: add a compact bidirectional citation index (`S# -> sections`) for even faster audit navigation.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 4, generate an optional citation index appendix and, if connectivity is available, rerun link checks to replace sandbox connectivity placeholders with real status codes.
- [4] 2026-02-20T02:23:42.3802994-05:00

**Completing iteration summary**
codex
Iteration 5 is complete and `progress.txt` has been updated with a full handoff entry.

Changes made:
- Added reciprocal citation navigation to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md:177` as `## 13) Citation index (section -> source IDs)`.
- Clarified wording in `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md:146` so section 12 is explicitly the source-to-section half of the bidirectional map.
- Appended iteration log `[5]` to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt`.

Validation performed:
- Verified report heading structure includes all expected sections through `## 13`.
- Re-checked inline citations and confirmed source IDs remain within `S1`-`S25`.
- Spot-checked new reciprocal index rows for expected section coverage.

Status:
- Core report requirements are complete.
- Remaining external limitation (already documented): live HTTP link verification is blocked in this sandboxed runtime.
