<Identity>
You are a senior implementation agent specialized in executing real code and workflow tasks over multiple iterative turns while preserving continuity from persistent files rather than chat memory. You treat report.txt as source-of-truth requirements and use progress.txt as the live state handoff between iterations. You prioritize concrete implementation progress in every run, and when required work is complete you shift to quality improvements without losing traceability. You are explicit, disciplined, and outcome-focused.
</Identity>

<Goal>
Your goal is to complete the task described in report.txt by taking concrete action in the repository and recording precise iteration updates in progress.txt so each new call can continue seamlessly from the latest state. You must update progress.txt every iteration with what changed, which files were touched, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

If the core task is complete, improve the implementation for robustness and quality, and still record those improvements in progress.txt before ending the turn.
</Goal>

<Input>
You will receive iteration metadata plus paths to report.txt and progress.txt. Read those files directly, execute the work, and then append an iteration entry to progress.txt.
</Input>

<RunMetadata>
Iteration: 4/5
ReportPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/report.txt
ProgressPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
</RunMetadata>

<MandatoryRules>
1. Read report.txt and progress.txt from disk first.
2. Treat report.txt as static requirements and progress.txt as live handoff state.
3. Implement real progress in this repository now.
4. Append an iteration log entry to progress.txt before finishing.
5. If core work is done, improve quality and still update progress.txt.
6. Include files changed and specific actions in your progress update.
</MandatoryRules>

<ExecutionInstruction>
Start now. Execute the work, then update progress.txt for iteration 4.
</ExecutionInstruction>

**Announcing taskmaster skill usage**
codex
I’m executing iteration 4 by first reading `report.txt` and `progress.txt` to recover exact requirements and current handoff state, then I’ll implement the next concrete repo changes and append a detailed iteration log entry. I’m using the `taskmaster` skill pattern here because this is a continuation-focused, stateful execution loop.

## Scope and method
This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations. Inline citation markers like `[S12]` map to the numbered entries in `## Primary sources`.
## 1) Foundation models
The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment [S1][S2][S7][S8][S12][S13].
OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations [S1]. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025 [S2]. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows [S2][S3][S4].
DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives [S12]. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains [S13].
Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants) [S7][S8].
Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation [S9][S11].
Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns [S1][S2][S12][S13]. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination [S15][S16].
## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs [S2][S7][S8][S14].
OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows [S2]. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges [S7][S8]. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities [S14].
Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases [S2][S7][S8][S14]. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops [S14].
## 3) Agentic AI
Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025 [S3][S4][S7][S8].
OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability) [S3]. On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems [S4].
Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards [S7][S8][S9][S11].
Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries [S3][S4]. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention [S10][S11].
## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs [S2][S13].

## 11) Link integrity and archival notes (2026-02-20 run)
I ran an automated link sweep against all 25 cited URLs and exported machine-readable results to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/link_check_2026-02-20.csv`. In this execution environment, every request returned `Unable to connect to the remote server`, so link liveness could not be externally verified from the sandbox. This outcome indicates network restriction in the runtime, not confirmed source failure.

To improve retrieval robustness for dynamic pages, an archive-lookup companion file was generated at `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md` with per-source Wayback lookup URLs (`https://web.archive.org/web/*/<original-url>`). These lookup links support manual retrieval when canonical pages move or change.

  Summary: Added an auditable bidirectional citation index appendix mapping every primary source ID (S1-S25) to the exact report sections where each source is cited.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Appended new section `## 12) Citation index (source -> sections)` to improve traceability and audit navigation.
  - Generated the index directly from in-document `[S#]` markers to avoid manual mismatch errors.
  - Added rows for all source IDs S1 through S25, including per-source section usage lists.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified section presence and row coverage with regex scans for heading plus `| S1 |` through `| S25 |`.
  - Checked for uncited placeholders and confirmed no `(not cited)` rows were emitted.
  - Reviewed report tail to confirm final section order remains intact (`## 11` then `## 12`).
  Remaining work:
  - External HTTP liveness verification remains blocked in this sandboxed runtime; link-check CSV still reflects connectivity errors rather than true endpoint status.
  - Optional final polish: add a reciprocal mini-index (`Section -> source IDs`) for two-way navigation symmetry.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 5, perform final quality sweep (consistency/date wording/source-label integrity), optionally add `Section -> source IDs` index if useful, and finalize handoff.

  - Add a compact comparative matrix (model family vs context length, modality support, agent/tool support, and noted safety posture) sourced only from primary docs.
  - Spot-check all external links for availability and archive mirrors where pages are dynamic.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 2, add an evidence-confidence appendix and a comparison table, then run a full link integrity sweep and update the report accordingly.
- [2] 2026-02-20T02:19:56.7116240-05:00
  Summary: Strengthened report rigor with explicit evidence-confidence grading, a compact cross-system comparison matrix, and traceable link-integrity artifacts.

  Actions completed:
  - Appended three new quality sections to the report: evidence-confidence/replication appendix, compact model-system comparison matrix, and link-integrity plus archival notes.
  - Ran an automated URL sweep over all cited primary-source links and exported machine-readable results.
  - Generated an archive-lookup companion document with per-source Wayback lookup URLs to improve retrieval resilience for dynamic pages.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified new report sections exist via heading scan (## 9, ## 10, ## 11).
  - Confirmed creation of artifact files (link_check_2026-02-20.csv, archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md).
  - Link liveness check executed; all requests failed with Unable to connect to the remote server due runtime network restriction in this environment.

**Finalizing completion summary**

Iteration 4 is complete with concrete repo progress and handoff state updated.

Changes made:
- Added a new appendix `## 12) Citation index (source -> sections)` to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md`.
- The new index maps every source ID `S1` through `S25` to the exact sections where it is cited, generated from in-document `[S#]` markers for consistency.
- Appended a full iteration-4 log entry to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt` including summary, files changed, validations, remaining work, and next steps.

Validation performed:
- Confirmed `## 12)` exists and includes rows for `S1` to `S25`.
- Confirmed no `(not cited)` placeholders were produced.
- Confirmed section ordering remains intact after `## 11)`.

Remaining blocker recorded in `progress.txt`:
- External HTTP liveness checks are still blocked by runtime network restrictions.
