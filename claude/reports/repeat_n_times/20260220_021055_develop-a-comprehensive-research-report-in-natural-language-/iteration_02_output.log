<Identity>
You are a senior implementation agent specialized in executing real code and workflow tasks over multiple iterative turns while preserving continuity from persistent files rather than chat memory. You treat report.txt as source-of-truth requirements and use progress.txt as the live state handoff between iterations. You prioritize concrete implementation progress in every run, and when required work is complete you shift to quality improvements without losing traceability. You are explicit, disciplined, and outcome-focused.
</Identity>

<Goal>
Your goal is to complete the task described in report.txt by taking concrete action in the repository and recording precise iteration updates in progress.txt so each new call can continue seamlessly from the latest state. You must update progress.txt every iteration with what changed, which files were touched, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

If the core task is complete, improve the implementation for robustness and quality, and still record those improvements in progress.txt before ending the turn.
</Goal>

<Input>
You will receive iteration metadata plus paths to report.txt and progress.txt. Read those files directly, execute the work, and then append an iteration entry to progress.txt.
</Input>

<RunMetadata>
Iteration: 2/5
ReportPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/report.txt
ProgressPath: claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
</RunMetadata>

<MandatoryRules>
1. Read report.txt and progress.txt from disk first.
2. Treat report.txt as static requirements and progress.txt as live handoff state.
3. Implement real progress in this repository now.
4. Append an iteration log entry to progress.txt before finishing.
5. If core work is done, improve quality and still update progress.txt.
6. Include files changed and specific actions in your progress update.
</MandatoryRules>

<ExecutionInstruction>
Start now. Execute the work, then update progress.txt for iteration 2.
</ExecutionInstruction>

**Preparing to apply taskmaster skill**
codex
I’m going to read `report.txt` and `progress.txt` first, then implement the next concrete slice of work and append an iteration 2 entry to `progress.txt`. I’ll also apply the `taskmaster` skill to keep strict continuity and completion discipline across iterations.

# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)

## Scope and method
This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.

## 1) Foundation models
The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.

OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.

DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.

Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).

Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.

Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.

## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.

+## 9) Evidence confidence and replication appendix
+This appendix labels major claims by confidence and replication status. `High` means the claim is grounded in primary technical artifacts and/or broad independent confirmation. `Medium` means the claim is strongly supported by primary vendor documentation but limited independent replication is publicly available. `Low` means the claim is early, benchmark-sensitive, or mostly vendor-reported with limited external validation.
+
+| Area | Representative claim | Confidence | Replication status | Why this label |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| Foundation models | Long-context and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier patterns. | High | Multi-org convergence (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Anthropic docs) | Multiple independent model families describe similar design trends. |
+| Foundation models | Any one vendor model is definitively superior overall. | Low | Not replicated across neutral harnesses | Rankings vary by benchmark design, contamination controls, and task mix. |
+| Multimodal systems | Text+image understanding for practical workflows is production-ready. | High | Observed across major model providers and deployments | Capabilities are repeatedly documented in official product/research releases. |
+| Agentic AI | Tool-calling agent stacks are operationally viable in constrained domains. | High | Widely reproduced in enterprise/product integrations | API-level primitives and orchestration frameworks are now mature. |
+| Agentic AI | Fully autonomous, long-horizon open-world agents are broadly reliable. | Low | Limited independent replication | Public evidence still shows brittleness and safety/control gaps. |
+| Reasoning/planning | Test-time reasoning budgets and tool use can improve hard-task performance. | Medium | Partially replicated, but sensitive to setup | Gains are common, but effect size depends on prompt, tools, and eval protocol. |
+| Efficiency optimization | Sparse activation, kernel optimization, and architecture changes reduce cost. | High | Replicated at multiple stack layers | Supported by papers (e.g., FlashAttention-3, SSM/Transformer links, MoE reports). |
+| Evaluation | Static benchmark saturation and contamination risk are significant issues. | High | Independently echoed by multiple benchmark efforts | Live/refreshing benchmark work directly targets this failure mode. |
+| Safety/alignment | Layered defenses plus continuous eval publication are current best practice. | High | Cross-lab operational pattern | Preparedness frameworks, system cards, and ongoing safety hubs support this. |
+| Robotics | VLA policies plus synthetic-data loops are now core robotics strategy. | Medium | Growing but uneven replication across embodiments | Results are promising, but reliability under distribution shift remains open. |

+| Google Gemini 2.0 family (Dec 2024-Feb 2025) | Not publicly fixed in launch blog posts | Native multimodal I/O (text/image/audio; product-dependent) | Framed for agentic use cases and tool-connected prototypes | Safety details distributed across model/update documentation |
+| Anthropic Claude 4-class line (2025-2026 system cards) | Not publicly fixed in consolidated system-card index | Multimodal capabilities documented by model | Agentic/computer-use risk treatment appears in safety docs | System-card-centric release safety narrative |
+| DeepSeek-V3 (Dec 2024, rev Feb 2025) | Paper-reported long-context operation (configuration-dependent) | Primarily language model in cited report | Tooling is external/orchestration-level, not core launch narrative | Limited dedicated safety disclosure versus major commercial labs |
+| DeepSeek-R1 (Jan 2025, rev Jan 2026) | Reasoning-time compute emphasis over public max-context marketing | Primarily language reasoning in cited report | Commonly used with tool wrappers; not presented as full agent platform | Safety posture less formalized in public paper artifact |
+| Qwen2.5-VL (Feb 2025) | Long-video/time encoding indicates long-sequence visual design | Strong vision-language focus with localization support | Agent/tool behavior usually added via framework layer | Safety details are less centralized in the cited technical report |

+## 9) Evidence confidence and replication appendix
+This appendix labels major claims by confidence and replication status. `High` means the claim is grounded in primary technical artifacts and/or broad independent confirmation. `Medium` means the claim is strongly supported by primary vendor documentation but limited independent replication is publicly available. `Low` means the claim is early, benchmark-sensitive, or mostly vendor-reported with limited external validation.
+
+| Area | Representative claim | Confidence | Replication status | Why this label |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| Foundation models | Long-context and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier patterns. | High | Multi-org convergence (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Anthropic docs) | Multiple independent model families describe similar design trends. |
+| Foundation models | Any one vendor model is definitively superior overall. | Low | Not replicated across neutral harnesses | Rankings vary by benchmark design, contamination controls, and task mix. |
+| Multimodal systems | Text+image understanding for practical workflows is production-ready. | High | Observed across major model providers and deployments | Capabilities are repeatedly documented in official product/research releases. |
+| Agentic AI | Tool-calling agent stacks are operationally viable in constrained domains. | High | Widely reproduced in enterprise/product integrations | API-level primitives and orchestration frameworks are now mature. |
+| Agentic AI | Fully autonomous, long-horizon open-world agents are broadly reliable. | Low | Limited independent replication | Public evidence still shows brittleness and safety/control gaps. |
+| Reasoning/planning | Test-time reasoning budgets and tool use can improve hard-task performance. | Medium | Partially replicated, but sensitive to setup | Gains are common, but effect size depends on prompt, tools, and eval protocol. |
+| Efficiency optimization | Sparse activation, kernel optimization, and architecture changes reduce cost. | High | Replicated at multiple stack layers | Supported by papers (e.g., FlashAttention-3, SSM/Transformer links, MoE reports). |
+| Evaluation | Static benchmark saturation and contamination risk are significant issues. | High | Independently echoed by multiple benchmark efforts | Live/refreshing benchmark work directly targets this failure mode. |
+| Safety/alignment | Layered defenses plus continuous eval publication are current best practice. | High | Cross-lab operational pattern | Preparedness frameworks, system cards, and ongoing safety hubs support this. |
+| Robotics | VLA policies plus synthetic-data loops are now core robotics strategy. | Medium | Growing but uneven replication across embodiments | Results are promising, but reliability under distribution shift remains open. |
+
+## 10) Compact model/system comparison matrix
+The table below is intentionally compact and conservative. Cells marked `Not publicly fixed/disclosed` reflect gaps in the cited primary documents rather than missing analysis.

+| Family/system (primary source period) | Context length posture | Modalities | Agent/tool support posture | Safety posture in primary docs |

+| Anthropic Claude 4-class line (2025-2026 system cards) | Not publicly fixed in consolidated system-card index | Multimodal capabilities documented by model | Agentic/computer-use risk treatment appears in safety docs | System-card-centric release safety narrative |
+| DeepSeek-V3 (Dec 2024, rev Feb 2025) | Paper-reported long-context operation (configuration-dependent) | Primarily language model in cited report | Tooling is external/orchestration-level, not core launch narrative | Limited dedicated safety disclosure versus major commercial labs |
+| DeepSeek-R1 (Jan 2025, rev Jan 2026) | Reasoning-time compute emphasis over public max-context marketing | Primarily language reasoning in cited report | Commonly used with tool wrappers; not presented as full agent platform | Safety posture less formalized in public paper artifact |
+| Qwen2.5-VL (Feb 2025) | Long-video/time encoding indicates long-sequence visual design | Strong vision-language focus with localization support | Agent/tool behavior usually added via framework layer | Safety details are less centralized in the cited technical report |

+## 9) Evidence confidence and replication appendix
+This appendix labels major claims by confidence and replication status. `High` means the claim is grounded in primary technical artifacts and/or broad independent confirmation. `Medium` means the claim is strongly supported by primary vendor documentation but limited independent replication is publicly available. `Low` means the claim is early, benchmark-sensitive, or mostly vendor-reported with limited external validation.
+
+| Area | Representative claim | Confidence | Replication status | Why this label |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| Foundation models | Long-context and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier patterns. | High | Multi-org convergence (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Anthropic docs) | Multiple independent model families describe similar design trends. |
+| Foundation models | Any one vendor model is definitively superior overall. | Low | Not replicated across neutral harnesses | Rankings vary by benchmark design, contamination controls, and task mix. |
+| Multimodal systems | Text+image understanding for practical workflows is production-ready. | High | Observed across major model providers and deployments | Capabilities are repeatedly documented in official product/research releases. |
+| Agentic AI | Tool-calling agent stacks are operationally viable in constrained domains. | High | Widely reproduced in enterprise/product integrations | API-level primitives and orchestration frameworks are now mature. |
+| Agentic AI | Fully autonomous, long-horizon open-world agents are broadly reliable. | Low | Limited independent replication | Public evidence still shows brittleness and safety/control gaps. |
+| Reasoning/planning | Test-time reasoning budgets and tool use can improve hard-task performance. | Medium | Partially replicated, but sensitive to setup | Gains are common, but effect size depends on prompt, tools, and eval protocol. |
+| Efficiency optimization | Sparse activation, kernel optimization, and architecture changes reduce cost. | High | Replicated at multiple stack layers | Supported by papers (e.g., FlashAttention-3, SSM/Transformer links, MoE reports). |
+| Evaluation | Static benchmark saturation and contamination risk are significant issues. | High | Independently echoed by multiple benchmark efforts | Live/refreshing benchmark work directly targets this failure mode. |
+| Safety/alignment | Layered defenses plus continuous eval publication are current best practice. | High | Cross-lab operational pattern | Preparedness frameworks, system cards, and ongoing safety hubs support this. |
+| Robotics | VLA policies plus synthetic-data loops are now core robotics strategy. | Medium | Growing but uneven replication across embodiments | Results are promising, but reliability under distribution shift remains open. |
+
+## 10) Compact model/system comparison matrix
+The table below is intentionally compact and conservative. Cells marked `Not publicly fixed/disclosed` reflect gaps in the cited primary documents rather than missing analysis.
+
+| Family/system (primary source period) | Context length posture | Modalities | Agent/tool support posture | Safety posture in primary docs |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| OpenAI GPT-4.1 (April 2025) | Up to 1M tokens reported | Text-first with broader platform multimodality | Strong API/tool integration in adjacent agent stack | Preparedness framework + safety hub governance context |
+| OpenAI o3/o4-mini (April 2025; update June 2025) | Long-context reasoning posture emphasized; exact limits vary by endpoint | Text+image reasoning explicitly highlighted | First-class tool use in Responses/Agents workflow | Evaluated within ongoing safety publication model |
+| Google Gemini 2.0 family (Dec 2024-Feb 2025) | Not publicly fixed in launch blog posts | Native multimodal I/O (text/image/audio; product-dependent) | Framed for agentic use cases and tool-connected prototypes | Safety details distributed across model/update documentation |
+| Anthropic Claude 4-class line (2025-2026 system cards) | Not publicly fixed in consolidated system-card index | Multimodal capabilities documented by model | Agentic/computer-use risk treatment appears in safety docs | System-card-centric release safety narrative |
+| DeepSeek-V3 (Dec 2024, rev Feb 2025) | Paper-reported long-context operation (configuration-dependent) | Primarily language model in cited report | Tooling is external/orchestration-level, not core launch narrative | Limited dedicated safety disclosure versus major commercial labs |
+| DeepSeek-R1 (Jan 2025, rev Jan 2026) | Reasoning-time compute emphasis over public max-context marketing | Primarily language reasoning in cited report | Commonly used with tool wrappers; not presented as full agent platform | Safety posture less formalized in public paper artifact |
+| Qwen2.5-VL (Feb 2025) | Long-video/time encoding indicates long-sequence visual design | Strong vision-language focus with localization support | Agent/tool behavior usually added via framework layer | Safety details are less centralized in the cited technical report |
+| GR00T N1 / pi_0 / RT-X robotics line (2023-2026) | Not directly comparable to LLM token windows | Vision-language-action embodied control | Tooling maps to robot stack and simulation infrastructure | Safety emphasis shifts to physical-world constraints and deployment gating |
+
+## 11) Link integrity and archival notes (2026-02-20 run)
+I ran an automated link sweep against all 25 cited URLs and exported machine-readable results to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/link_check_2026-02-20.csv`. In this execution environment, every request returned `Unable to connect to the remote server`, so link liveness could not be externally verified from the sandbox. This outcome indicates network restriction in the runtime, not confirmed source failure.
+
+To improve retrieval robustness for dynamic pages, an archive-lookup companion file was generated at `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md` with per-source Wayback lookup URLs (`https://web.archive.org/web/*/<original-url>`). These lookup links support manual retrieval when canonical pages move or change.

  Actions completed:
  - Appended three new quality sections to the report: evidence-confidence/replication appendix, compact model-system comparison matrix, and link-integrity plus archival notes.
  - Ran an automated URL sweep over all cited primary-source links and exported machine-readable results.
  - Generated an archive-lookup companion document with per-source Wayback lookup URLs to improve retrieval resilience for dynamic pages.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified new report sections exist via heading scan (`## 9`, `## 10`, `## 11`).
  - Confirmed creation of artifact files (`link_check_2026-02-20.csv`, `archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md`).
  - Link liveness check executed; all requests failed with `Unable to connect to the remote server` due runtime network restriction in this environment.
  Remaining work:
  - Perform an external-network link verification pass (outside restricted sandbox) to replace connectivity-error placeholders with real HTTP status outcomes.
  - Optionally add per-claim inline source IDs (e.g., [S12], [S13]) in core narrative paragraphs for faster auditability.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 3, run a non-sandboxed/connected link validation pass if available and fold real status codes plus any corrected URLs back into the report and appendix.

  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Created a new report artifact with full-sentence analysis across all required areas: foundation models, multimodal systems, agentic AI, reasoning/planning, efficiency optimization, evaluation, safety/alignment, and robotics.
  - Added explicit publication dates, concrete model/system names, and direct primary links (technical reports, system cards, official research/product announcements).
  - Explicitly separated established results from emerging claims in each major area.
  - Added concise sections on open problems and practical implications for builders.
  - Included a consolidated primary-source reference list (25 entries) at the end of the report.
  Validation attempted:
  - Verified report file creation with Test-Path.
  - Verified major required headings with rg "^## [1-8]\\)" and verified closing sections (Open problems, Practical implications, Primary sources).
  Remaining work:
  - Tighten evidence grading by adding confidence labels per claim (high/medium/low) and explicit independent-replication status where available.
  - Add a compact comparative matrix (model family vs context length, modality support, agent/tool support, and noted safety posture) sourced only from primary docs.
  - Spot-check all external links for availability and archive mirrors where pages are dynamic.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 2, add an evidence-confidence appendix and a comparison table, then run a full link integrity sweep and update the report accordingly.

+## 9) Evidence confidence and replication appendix
+This appendix labels major claims by confidence and replication status. `High` means the claim is grounded in primary technical artifacts and/or broad independent confirmation. `Medium` means the claim is strongly supported by primary vendor documentation but limited independent replication is publicly available. `Low` means the claim is early, benchmark-sensitive, or mostly vendor-reported with limited external validation.
+
+| Area | Representative claim | Confidence | Replication status | Why this label |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| Foundation models | Long-context and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier patterns. | High | Multi-org convergence (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Anthropic docs) | Multiple independent model families describe similar design trends. |
+| Foundation models | Any one vendor model is definitively superior overall. | Low | Not replicated across neutral harnesses | Rankings vary by benchmark design, contamination controls, and task mix. |
+| Multimodal systems | Text+image understanding for practical workflows is production-ready. | High | Observed across major model providers and deployments | Capabilities are repeatedly documented in official product/research releases. |
+| Agentic AI | Tool-calling agent stacks are operationally viable in constrained domains. | High | Widely reproduced in enterprise/product integrations | API-level primitives and orchestration frameworks are now mature. |
+| Agentic AI | Fully autonomous, long-horizon open-world agents are broadly reliable. | Low | Limited independent replication | Public evidence still shows brittleness and safety/control gaps. |
+| Reasoning/planning | Test-time reasoning budgets and tool use can improve hard-task performance. | Medium | Partially replicated, but sensitive to setup | Gains are common, but effect size depends on prompt, tools, and eval protocol. |
+| Efficiency optimization | Sparse activation, kernel optimization, and architecture changes reduce cost. | High | Replicated at multiple stack layers | Supported by papers (e.g., FlashAttention-3, SSM/Transformer links, MoE reports). |
+| Evaluation | Static benchmark saturation and contamination risk are significant issues. | High | Independently echoed by multiple benchmark efforts | Live/refreshing benchmark work directly targets this failure mode. |
+| Safety/alignment | Layered defenses plus continuous eval publication are current best practice. | High | Cross-lab operational pattern | Preparedness frameworks, system cards, and ongoing safety hubs support this. |
+| Robotics | VLA policies plus synthetic-data loops are now core robotics strategy. | Medium | Growing but uneven replication across embodiments | Results are promising, but reliability under distribution shift remains open. |
+
+## 10) Compact model/system comparison matrix
+The table below is intentionally compact and conservative. Cells marked `Not publicly fixed/disclosed` reflect gaps in the cited primary documents rather than missing analysis.
+
+| Family/system (primary source period) | Context length posture | Modalities | Agent/tool support posture | Safety posture in primary docs |
+|---|---|---|---|---|
+| OpenAI GPT-4.1 (April 2025) | Up to 1M tokens reported | Text-first with broader platform multimodality | Strong API/tool integration in adjacent agent stack | Preparedness framework + safety hub governance context |
+| OpenAI o3/o4-mini (April 2025; update June 2025) | Long-context reasoning posture emphasized; exact limits vary by endpoint | Text+image reasoning explicitly highlighted | First-class tool use in Responses/Agents workflow | Evaluated within ongoing safety publication model |
+| Google Gemini 2.0 family (Dec 2024-Feb 2025) | Not publicly fixed in launch blog posts | Native multimodal I/O (text/image/audio; product-dependent) | Framed for agentic use cases and tool-connected prototypes | Safety details distributed across model/update documentation |
+| Anthropic Claude 4-class line (2025-2026 system cards) | Not publicly fixed in consolidated system-card index | Multimodal capabilities documented by model | Agentic/computer-use risk treatment appears in safety docs | System-card-centric release safety narrative |
+| DeepSeek-V3 (Dec 2024, rev Feb 2025) | Paper-reported long-context operation (configuration-dependent) | Primarily language model in cited report | Tooling is external/orchestration-level, not core launch narrative | Limited dedicated safety disclosure versus major commercial labs |
+| DeepSeek-R1 (Jan 2025, rev Jan 2026) | Reasoning-time compute emphasis over public max-context marketing | Primarily language reasoning in cited report | Commonly used with tool wrappers; not presented as full agent platform | Safety posture less formalized in public paper artifact |
+| Qwen2.5-VL (Feb 2025) | Long-video/time encoding indicates long-sequence visual design | Strong vision-language focus with localization support | Agent/tool behavior usually added via framework layer | Safety details are less centralized in the cited technical report |
+| GR00T N1 / pi_0 / RT-X robotics line (2023-2026) | Not directly comparable to LLM token windows | Vision-language-action embodied control | Tooling maps to robot stack and simulation infrastructure | Safety emphasis shifts to physical-world constraints and deployment gating |
+
+## 11) Link integrity and archival notes (2026-02-20 run)
+I ran an automated link sweep against all 25 cited URLs and exported machine-readable results to `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/link_check_2026-02-20.csv`. In this execution environment, every request returned `Unable to connect to the remote server`, so link liveness could not be externally verified from the sandbox. This outcome indicates network restriction in the runtime, not confirmed source failure.
+
+To improve retrieval robustness for dynamic pages, an archive-lookup companion file was generated at `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/archive_lookup_2026-02-20.md` with per-source Wayback lookup URLs (`https://web.archive.org/web/*/<original-url>`). These lookup links support manual retrieval when canonical pages move or change.
