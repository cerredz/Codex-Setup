<Identity>
You are a senior implementation agent specialized in executing real code and workflow tasks over multiple iterative turns while preserving continuity from persistent files rather than chat memory. You treat report.txt as source-of-truth requirements and use progress.txt as the live state handoff between iterations. You prioritize concrete implementation progress in every run, and when required work is complete you shift to quality improvements without losing traceability. You are explicit, disciplined, and outcome-focused.
</Identity>

<Goal>
Your goal is to complete the task described in report.txt by taking concrete action in the repository and recording precise iteration updates in progress.txt so each new call can continue seamlessly from the latest state. You must update progress.txt every iteration with what changed, which files were touched, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

If the core task is complete, improve the implementation for robustness and quality, and still record those improvements in progress.txt before ending the turn.
</Goal>

<Input>
You will receive iteration metadata plus paths to report.txt and progress.txt. Read those files directly, execute the work, and then append an iteration entry to progress.txt.

</RunMetadata>

<MandatoryRules>
1. Read report.txt and progress.txt from disk first.
2. Treat report.txt as static requirements and progress.txt as live handoff state.
3. Implement real progress in this repository now.
4. Append an iteration log entry to progress.txt before finishing.
5. If core work is done, improve quality and still update progress.txt.
6. Include files changed and specific actions in your progress update.
</MandatoryRules>

<ExecutionInstruction>
Start now. Execute the work, then update progress.txt for iteration 3.
</ExecutionInstruction>

**Confirming skill usage and reading files**

I’ll execute iteration 3 by first reading `report.txt` and `progress.txt`, then I’ll implement the next concrete repo changes and append a precise handoff entry to `progress.txt`. I’m also using the `taskmaster` skill because this task requires strict continuation tracking across iterations.

# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)

## Scope and method
This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.

## 1) Foundation models
The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.

OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.

DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.

Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).

Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.

Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.

## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.

**Planning inline source ID addition**

I’m now improving auditability by adding inline source IDs (`[S#]`) throughout the core narrative so each major claim can be traced directly to the primary source list without leaving the section. After that I’ll log iteration 3 details in `progress.txt`.

In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

 ## Practical implications for builders
-Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

 ## Open problems (concise)
-1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
-2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
-3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
-4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
-5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.

 ## Practical implications for builders
-Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

 ## Open problems (concise)
-1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
-2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
-3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
-4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
-5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.

 ## Practical implications for builders
-Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

  Summary: Added full inline source-traceability markers across the core narrative and open-problem bullets to improve auditability of each claim against the primary-source list.
  Files changed:
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md
  - claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt
  Actions completed:
  - Updated sections 1-8, Scope/method, Open problems, and Practical implications with inline "'`[S#]` references tied to the numbered `Primary sources` entries.
  - Added explicit citation-usage guidance in the methodology section so readers can map narrative claims directly to source IDs.
  - Rephrased evaluation caveat language to anchor contamination/memorization concerns to cited benchmark artifacts rather than uncited general claims.
  Validation attempted:
  - Ran regex-based citation checks to confirm only valid source IDs are used (`S1`-`S25`) with no out-of-range references.
  - Confirmed section structure remained intact after edits (all required headings still present).
  Remaining work:
  - External HTTP liveness verification is still blocked in this runtime due network restrictions; current link-integrity artifact still reflects connectivity failures, not endpoint truth.
  - Optional: add a compact bidirectional citation index (`S# -> sections`) for even faster audit navigation.
  Immediate next steps:
  - In iteration 4, generate an optional citation index appendix and, if connectivity is available, rerun link checks to replace sandbox connectivity placeholders with real status codes.

 ## Practical implications for builders
-Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

 ## Practical implications for builders
-Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

Iteration 3 is complete with concrete repo updates and handoff logging.

### What I changed
- Added inline source markers (`[S#]`) throughout the report narrative for direct claim-to-source traceability:
  - `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/research_report_2026-02-20.md`
- Updated the methodology sentence to explain citation marker mapping to `## Primary sources`.
- Added citations to all `## Open problems (concise)` bullets.
- Tightened one evaluation paragraph so contamination/memorization caveats are explicitly tied to cited benchmark artifacts.

### Validation run
- Verified citation IDs are valid and in range (`S1`-`S25`), with no invalid markers.
- Verified required section headings are still present.

### Progress handoff updated
- Appended iteration `[3]` entry with summary, files changed, validation, remaining work, and immediate next steps:

 # AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
 
 ## Scope and method
-This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.

-OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.

-OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.

At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
