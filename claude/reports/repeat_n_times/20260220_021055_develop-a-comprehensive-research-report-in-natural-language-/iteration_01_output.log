<Identity>
You are a senior implementation agent specialized in executing real code and workflow tasks over multiple iterative turns while preserving continuity from persistent files rather than chat memory. You treat report.txt as source-of-truth requirements and use progress.txt as the live state handoff between iterations. You prioritize concrete implementation progress in every run, and when required work is complete you shift to quality improvements without losing traceability. You are explicit, disciplined, and outcome-focused.
</Identity>

<Goal>
Your goal is to complete the task described in report.txt by taking concrete action in the repository and recording precise iteration updates in progress.txt so each new call can continue seamlessly from the latest state. You must update progress.txt every iteration with what changed, which files were touched, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

If the core task is complete, improve the implementation for robustness and quality, and still record those improvements in progress.txt before ending the turn.
</Goal>

<Input>
You will receive iteration metadata plus paths to report.txt and progress.txt. Read those files directly, execute the work, and then append an iteration entry to progress.txt.

</RunMetadata>

<MandatoryRules>
1. Read report.txt and progress.txt from disk first.
2. Treat report.txt as static requirements and progress.txt as live handoff state.
3. Implement real progress in this repository now.
4. Append an iteration log entry to progress.txt before finishing.
5. If core work is done, improve quality and still update progress.txt.
6. Include files changed and specific actions in your progress update.
</MandatoryRules>

<ExecutionInstruction>
Start now. Execute the work, then update progress.txt for iteration 1.
</ExecutionInstruction>

**Selecting minimal skill usage**
codex
I’m starting by reading `report.txt` and `progress.txt` to extract the exact requirements and current handoff state, then I’ll implement the first concrete changes and log iteration 1 updates. I’m using the `taskmaster` skill because this task requires strict continuation discipline and explicit unfinished-work tracking.

Context Header
Purpose: Defines the global Taskmaster skill for Codex sessions so users can explicitly invoke a strict completion workflow before the agent stops.
Responsibilities:
- Describe the Taskmaster completion-review process in a Codex-friendly format.
- Define the continuation-cap behavior and the default limit used by this installation.
- Point to the optional hook implementation for environments that support stop hooks.
Boundaries:
- Does not auto-register stop hooks in Codex.
- Does not execute shell hooks by itself; this file only defines reusable skill guidance.

Great. Now here is what I want you to do. I want you to generate a plan to create a skill prompt for creating images. the final skill files is located at images/create_image.md. Here is the overall process that I want you to employ to create this skill file. Basically For creating the prompt, I want you to follow the lm_promptengineer.skill file that we have created to create the start of this prompt. Then I want to an "examples" section to the end of this prompt, Where each example is an extremely detailed and comprehensive JSON object of the corresponding image that it represents. So basically you should go through each of the images in the image file and create a singular JSON object for this image. This JSON object should be extremely comprehensive, extremely detailed, and aim at replicating the image that it corresponds to. You should then append all of these JSON objects to the end of the image skill file after the identity and goal sections. Note, also create a new directory for all of the json objects that you create inside of json directory, and have a file for each one. I do not want you to implement this all at once. I want you to first create an extremely detailed plan for each task that you need to achieve and to reference the attached skill files as well.

# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)

## Scope and method
This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.

## 1) Foundation models
The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.

OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.

DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.

Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).

Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.

Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.

## 2) Multimodal systems
Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.

OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.

Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.

## 3) Agentic AI
Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.

OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.

Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.

Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.

## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.

OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.

Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.

## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.

DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.

Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.

## 6) Evaluation
Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.

Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.

Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.

## 7) Safety and alignment
Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.

OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.

Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.

Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.

## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.

Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.

NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.

Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.

## Open problems (concise)
1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.

## Practical implications for builders
Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.

+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.

+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.

+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).

FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models
+The strongest foundation-model trend through 2025 and into early 2026 is convergence around three ideas: large-scale reinforcement learning for reasoning, broad multimodal I/O, and high-context tool-using deployment.
+
+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+OpenAI announced GPT-4.1 on April 14, 2025, with improvements in coding, instruction following, and long-context handling (up to 1M tokens) relative to GPT-4o in its own published evaluations. Two days later, on April 16, 2025, OpenAI announced o3 and o4-mini as reasoning-first models and later updated that o3-pro became available on June 10, 2025. These releases explicitly describe longer reasoning and tighter tool integration in ChatGPT and API workflows.
+
+DeepSeek published DeepSeek-V3 on arXiv on December 27, 2024 (revised February 18, 2025), emphasizing MoE scale (671B total, 37B active), Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and multi-token prediction objectives. DeepSeek-R1 was submitted on January 22, 2025 and revised on January 4, 2026, with the paper framing pure RL and staged RL pipelines as central to reasoning gains.
+
+Google introduced Gemini 2.0 on December 11, 2024 as a model family oriented toward "agentic" use, with native multimodal output and tool use, then published broader Gemini 2.0 availability and model lineup updates on February 5, 2025 (including Flash-Lite and Pro experimental variants).
+
+Anthropic's system cards page (as crawled in February 2026) lists a progression from Claude Sonnet 3.7 (February 2025) through Claude 4-class models and up to Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026), indicating rapid model iteration cadence with accompanying safety documentation.
+
+Established results in this area are that MoE architectures, long-context operation, and RL-tuned reasoning are now standard frontier-model design patterns. Emerging claims are head-to-head benchmark superiority claims that remain mostly vendor-reported and sensitive to harness design and contamination.
+
+## 2) Multimodal systems
+Multimodal systems have moved from image understanding add-ons toward unified models that reason across text, image, audio, and tool outputs.
+
+OpenAI's o3/o4-mini release text states that these reasoning models can "think with images" and integrate visual inputs directly into reasoning workflows. Google documented Gemini 2.0 advances in native image and audio output and highlighted early agent prototypes (for example, Project Astra updates) as practical multimodal-to-agent bridges. Qwen2.5-VL (submitted February 19, 2025) reports dynamic-resolution processing, absolute time encoding for long-video understanding, and explicit visual localization capabilities.
+
+Established results are that multimodal parsing of documents, diagrams, and mixed-media prompts is production-ready for many use cases. Emerging claims are around robust, always-correct visual reasoning under noisy real-world inputs and full reliability in autonomous visual-agent loops.
+
+## 3) Agentic AI
+Agentic AI shifted from ad hoc wrappers to first-class API and platform primitives during 2025.
+
+OpenAI's March 11, 2025 announcement introduced agent-building primitives (Responses API, built-in web/file/computer-use tools, Agents SDK, and observability). On May 21, 2025, OpenAI added remote MCP server support and additional Responses API capabilities (including background mode and richer tool orchestration patterns), which materially lowered integration friction for multi-tool systems.
+
+Google's Gemini 2.0 publications framed model evolution around the "agentic era," and Anthropic safety materials increasingly discuss agentic-computer-use and coding risk evaluations in system cards.
+
+Established results are that agent pipelines are now operationally viable for constrained workflows with clear tool boundaries. Emerging claims are around broad autonomous reliability on long-horizon, open-world tasks without human intervention.
+
+## 4) Reasoning and planning methods
+The most important algorithmic shift is explicit scaling of reasoning-time compute and RL for chain-of-thought quality, not only larger pretraining runs.
+
+OpenAI's o3 release notes directly describe continuing to scale reinforcement learning and report gains when models are allowed to "think longer." DeepSeek-R1 describes pure-RL and staged-RL pathways that produce self-reflection and verification behaviors on verifiable tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks increasingly combine internal reasoning with external tools, creating practical planning loops that blend model inference, search, code execution, and retrieval.
+
+Established results are that test-time reasoning budgets and tool-mediated planning measurably improve difficult-task performance. Emerging claims are that these systems robustly generalize to novel, high-stakes decision settings without brittle failure modes.
+
+## 5) Efficiency: training and inference optimization
+Efficiency breakthroughs remain central because they decide which capabilities become deployable.
+
+DeepSeek-V3 presents architecture-level efficiency (MLA, MoE routing choices, multi-token prediction). FlashAttention-3 (submitted July 11, 2024) reports large Hopper-GPU attention-kernel speedups with improved FP8 behavior. The Mamba-2/SSD paper (submitted May 31, 2024) formalizes links between transformers and state-space models and reports faster core layers while keeping competitive language-model performance.
+
+Established results are that kernel-level optimization, sparse activation, and architecture-level redesign now collectively drive cost/performance gains. Emerging claims are around how far these methods can scale while preserving robustness and calibration across modalities.
+
+## 6) Evaluation
+Evaluation quality became a bottleneck, not just model quality.
+
+Humanity's Last Exam (submitted January 24, 2025; revised September 25, 2025; later reported as Nature-published on January 28, 2026 on the project site) formalized a hard, expert-curated frontier benchmark. LiveBench (submitted June 27, 2024; revised April 18, 2025) emphasized contamination-limited evaluation with regular refreshes. At the same time, new 2025 analyses raised concrete concerns that strong SWE-bench-style outcomes can partially reflect memorization or contamination effects rather than robust general reasoning.
+
+Established results are that static benchmarks saturate quickly and require refresh cycles plus contamination controls. Emerging claims concern "true agent ability" on software and long-horizon tasks, where benchmark design still materially changes rankings.
+
+## 7) Safety and alignment
+Safety practice in 2025-2026 increasingly combines policy frameworks, ongoing dashboards, and focused technical defenses.
+
+OpenAI updated its Preparedness Framework on April 15, 2025 and added clearer capability/risk categories and safeguard governance concepts. OpenAI's Safety Evaluations Hub (last updated August 15, 2025) moved toward continuously published safety/performance slices instead of one-time launch snapshots.
+
+Anthropic's February 3, 2025 Constitutional Classifiers post reports large synthetic-eval jailbreak reductions (including a reduction to 4.4% jailbreak success in the described setup) with modest refusal-rate increase in sampled benign traffic. Anthropic system cards and Claude 4 system-card documentation also show deeper treatment of agentic misuse and autonomy risks in release decisions.
+
+Established results are that layered defenses, red-teaming, and continuous eval publication are now normal for frontier deployments. Emerging claims are about whether current guardrails will remain robust as model autonomy and multimodal capabilities continue to scale.
+
+## 8) Robotics and embodied AI
+Robotics is converging on foundation-policy pretraining, synthetic data scaling, and VLA (vision-language-action) control stacks.
+
+Open X-Embodiment and RT-X (originally submitted October 13, 2023; revised May 14, 2025) provided cross-institution, cross-robot dataset and transfer evidence (22 robots, 527 skills). pi_0 (submitted October 31, 2024; revised January 8, 2026) formalized flow-matching VLA control for general robot policies, and openpi (published February 4, 2025) made weights/code public while reporting practical fine-tuning with relatively small task data in some settings.
+
+NVIDIA announced Isaac GR00T N1 on March 18, 2025, including a dual-system control framing and heavy use of synthetic trajectories; NVIDIA's research page lists a March 17, 2025 publication date for the GR00T N1 whitepaper. Figure's February 26, 2025 Helix logistics update describes VLA deployment progress on real logistics manipulation tasks.
+
+Established results are that cross-embodiment pretraining and synthetic data loops are now core robotics strategies. Emerging claims are around reliability under distribution shift, safe autonomy in mixed human environments, and economically scalable real-world deployment.
+
+## Open problems (concise)
+1. Evaluation validity remains unresolved for fast-moving models because contamination, harness differences, and benchmark gaming can obscure true capability progress.
+2. Agent reliability is still fragile for long-horizon tasks that require robust memory, tool selection, and exception handling.
+3. Multimodal faithfulness remains imperfect, especially when models convert uncertain visual/audio inputs into high-confidence text.
+4. Safety mechanisms still face adaptive attacks, and guardrail robustness under stronger future models is not guaranteed.
+5. Robotics still depends on difficult sim-to-real transfer, long-tail physical edge cases, and costly data/ops loops.
+
+## Practical implications for builders
+Builders should treat frontier models as components in a controlled system, not self-sufficient products. In practice, the best results now come from combining a strong base model with explicit tool contracts, retrieval boundaries, deterministic post-processing, and task-specific eval harnesses. Teams should assume benchmark numbers are directional, validate on private workload traces, and maintain rollback-capable deployment gates for both quality and safety regressions.

+# AI Breakthroughs Report (As of February 20, 2026)
+
+## Scope and method
+This report summarizes major AI breakthroughs, algorithms, and engineering techniques that were publicly documented up to February 20, 2026. It prioritizes primary sources, including original technical reports, arXiv papers, system cards, and official product or research announcements. It distinguishes results that are already well-established in production or across multiple labs from claims that are still emerging and mostly supported by vendor-led evaluations.
+
+## 1) Foundation models

- `claude/reports/repeat_n_times/20260220_021055_develop-a-comprehensive-research-report-in-natural-language-/progress.txt`

What I implemented:
- Authored a full, sectioned AI research report (as of February 20, 2026) in natural language.
- Covered all required areas: foundation models, multimodal systems, agentic AI, reasoning/planning, efficiency, evaluation, safety/alignment, and robotics.
- Included concrete publication dates, specific model/system names, and primary-source links.
- Explicitly separated established results from emerging claims.
- Added concise open problems and practical implications for builders.
- Appended a detailed `[1]` iteration entry to `progress.txt` with actions completed, validation, remaining work, and immediate next steps.

Validation run:
- Confirmed report file exists (`Test-Path`).
- Confirmed required major headings and closing sections with `rg` scans.
