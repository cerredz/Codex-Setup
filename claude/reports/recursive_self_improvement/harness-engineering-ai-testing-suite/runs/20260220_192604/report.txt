## Primary Task

I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for things inside of the world of harness engineering. Basically I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside of projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing that I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.
