I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for harness engineering. Basically, I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI in projects, while making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is developing a test suite that is far more extensive than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.
