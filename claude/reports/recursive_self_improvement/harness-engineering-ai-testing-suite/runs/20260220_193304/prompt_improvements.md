# Prompt Improvements

## Prompt Version 1
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite inside the world of harness engineering. Basically, I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Matches the original objective and scope: comprehensive, robust, secure AI-related testing in harness engineering, with exact steps and codebase breakage prevention.

**Style Preservation Check**
Keeps the same direct, conversational tone and phrasing pattern, including "Basically" and "The thing I am trying to explore."

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 2
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for the world of harness engineering. Basically, I want to break down the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside projects, while making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is building a far more extensive test suite than regular, because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Preserves the same core objective, deliverable, and scope: exact step decomposition for a robust and secure AI-focused testing suite that protects the codebase.

**Style Preservation Check**
Maintains the user's informal, practical tone and sentence flow with minimal wording shifts.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 3
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for harness engineering. Basically, I want the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI in projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is creating a test suite that is far more extensive than regular, because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Keeps the original target intact: decompose exact steps for a robust, secure, AI-heavy testing setup that prevents breakage.

**Style Preservation Check**
Retains the same first-person, plainspoken tone and original intent without changing the workflow.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 4
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for harness engineering. Basically, I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI in projects, while making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is developing a test suite that is far more extensive than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Fully aligned with the original objective, scope, and deliverable: exact steps for a robust, secure, more extensive AI-focused testing suite that protects code stability.

**Style Preservation Check**
Preserves the user's voice, cadence, and informal framing while tightening clarity and order.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.
