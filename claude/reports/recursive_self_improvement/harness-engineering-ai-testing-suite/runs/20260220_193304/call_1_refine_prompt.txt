You are a recursive self-improvement prompt engineer.

Original task:
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for things inside of the world of harness engineering. Basically I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside of projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing that I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

Context report file: claude/reports/recursive_self_improvement/harness-engineering-ai-testing-suite/runs/20260220_193304/report.txt

Generate exactly 4 improved prompt versions that iteratively refine the prior version while preserving strict fidelity to the original task.
This is prompt enhancement, not prompt rewriting into a different style or workflow.

Hard constraints:
1) Keep the same core objective, deliverables, and scope as the original task.
2) Preserve the user's writing style and tone; the result should read like an improved extension of the original prompt, not a new template.
3) Do NOT add new requests, new goals, extra deliverables, new personas, new sections, or additional workflow requirements that were not in the original task.
4) Allowed changes are limited to clarity improvements, ambiguity reduction, better ordering, and tighter phrasing while keeping meaning constant.
5) If a candidate improvement introduces new requirements, reject it and revise.

Output requirements:
1) Write all versions to claude/reports/recursive_self_improvement/harness-engineering-ai-testing-suite/runs/20260220_193304/prompt_improvements.md as markdown.
2) Include sections:
   - "## Prompt Version 1" ... through "## Prompt Version 4"
   - For each version, include:
     - "Fidelity Check" (alignment to original objective/scope),
     - "Style Preservation Check" (how it keeps original writing style),
     - "Added Requirements Check" (must explicitly list "None" if no additions).
3) After the versions, include:
   - "## Final Selected Prompt"
   - A block delimited by:
     <<<FINAL_PROMPT_START>>>
     [full final prompt text here]
     <<<FINAL_PROMPT_END>>>
   - "## Selection Rationale"

Do not execute the task in this call; only produce improved prompts.
