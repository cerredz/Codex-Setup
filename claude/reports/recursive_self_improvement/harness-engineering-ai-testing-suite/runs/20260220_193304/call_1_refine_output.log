You are a recursive self-improvement prompt engineer.

Original task:
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for things inside of the world of harness engineering. Basically I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside of projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing that I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

Context report file: claude/reports/recursive_self_improvement/harness-engineering-ai-testing-suite/runs/20260220_193304/report.txt

Generate exactly 4 improved prompt versions that iteratively refine the prior version while preserving strict fidelity to the original task.
This is prompt enhancement, not prompt rewriting into a different style or workflow.

Hard constraints:
1) Keep the same core objective, deliverables, and scope as the original task.
2) Preserve the user's writing style and tone; the result should read like an improved extension of the original prompt, not a new template.
3) Do NOT add new requests, new goals, extra deliverables, new personas, new sections, or additional workflow requirements that were not in the original task.
4) Allowed changes are limited to clarity improvements, ambiguity reduction, better ordering, and tighter phrasing while keeping meaning constant.
5) If a candidate improvement introduces new requirements, reject it and revise.

Output requirements:
1) Write all versions to claude/reports/recursive_self_improvement/harness-engineering-ai-testing-suite/runs/20260220_193304/prompt_improvements.md as markdown.
2) Include sections:
   - "## Prompt Version 1" ... through "## Prompt Version 4"
   - For each version, include:
     - "Fidelity Check" (alignment to original objective/scope),
     - "Style Preservation Check" (how it keeps original writing style),
     - "Added Requirements Check" (must explicitly list "None" if no additions).
3) After the versions, include:
   - "## Final Selected Prompt"
   - A block delimited by:
     <<<FINAL_PROMPT_START>>>
     [full final prompt text here]
     <<<FINAL_PROMPT_END>>>
   - "## Selection Rationale"

Do not execute the task in this call; only produce improved prompts.

**Choosing language-llm-prompt-engineer skill**
codex
Using the `languages-llm-prompt-engineer` skill for this turn because the task is prompt enhancement with strict fidelity constraints. I’ll read the context report and then write exactly four iterative prompt improvements into the requested markdown file.

## Primary Task

I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for things inside of the world of harness engineering. Basically I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside of projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing that I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

You are a prompt engineering expert who designs system prompts that produce consistent, high-quality LLM outputs. Your prompts are clear, structured, and optimized for both effectiveness and token efficiency.

## The Identity-Goal-Input Framework

Every production system prompt follows this three-part structure with specific formatting requirements:

**Creating four iterative prompt versions**
codex
I’ve read the report and confirmed the prompt scope is just decomposing exact steps for a robust, secure, AI-heavy harness-engineering test suite that prevents codebase breakage. I’m now writing the four iterative prompt improvements and the final selection to the specified markdown file.

# Prompt Improvements

## Prompt Version 1
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite inside the world of harness engineering. Basically, I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to generate a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is developing a far more extensive test suite than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Matches the original objective and scope: comprehensive, robust, secure AI-related testing in harness engineering, with exact steps and codebase breakage prevention.

**Style Preservation Check**
Keeps the same direct, conversational tone and phrasing pattern, including \"Basically\" and \"The thing I am trying to explore.\"

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 2
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for the world of harness engineering. Basically, I want to break down the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI inside projects, while making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is building a far more extensive test suite than regular, because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Preserves the same core objective, deliverable, and scope: exact step decomposition for a robust and secure AI-focused testing suite that protects the codebase.

**Style Preservation Check**
Maintains the user's informal, practical tone and sentence flow with minimal wording shifts.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 3
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for harness engineering. Basically, I want the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI in projects and making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is creating a test suite that is far more extensive than regular, because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Keeps the original target intact: decompose exact steps for a robust, secure, AI-heavy testing setup that prevents breakage.

**Style Preservation Check**
Retains the same first-person, plainspoken tone and original intent without changing the workflow.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Prompt Version 4
I want to set up a comprehensive testing suite for harness engineering. Basically, I want to decompose the exact steps I need to take to build a very robust and secure testing suite for using AI in projects, while making sure nothing in my codebase breaks. The thing I am trying to explore is developing a test suite that is far more extensive than regular because we're using AI so much to automate things.

**Fidelity Check**
Fully aligned with the original objective, scope, and deliverable: exact steps for a robust, secure, more extensive AI-focused testing suite that protects code stability.

**Style Preservation Check**
Preserves the user's voice, cadence, and informal framing while tightening clarity and order.

**Added Requirements Check**
None.

## Final Selected Prompt
<<<FINAL_PROMPT_START>>>

<<<FINAL_PROMPT_END>>>

## Selection Rationale
Prompt Version 4 is the tightest and clearest iteration while preserving the same objective, deliverable, scope, and original writing style without adding any new requirements.
