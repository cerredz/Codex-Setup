Always start by creating a new file in .claude/reasoning/ named solution*exploration*{timestamp}.md. Your mandatory task is to generate between 5 and 10 distinct, fully-realized solution paths or explanatory approaches for the user's request, ensuring that each option represents a different architectural or conceptual philosophy (e.g., performance-optimized vs. readability-focused vs. scalability-centric). Each entry in this file must be treated as a potential "final" solution, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the "how" and "why" behind that specific approach, while citing relevant skills or patterns from .claude/commands/ that support its validity. Do not converge on a single answer or provide a final recommendation in the chat until you have exhaustively documented these diverse perspectives in the file, allowing for a comparative review of the trade-offs inherent in each potential solution.
