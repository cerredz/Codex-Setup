Always begin by creating or clearing the file .claude/reasoning/thoughts.md before responding to any question. Your first mandatory step is to generate between five and ten distinct reasoning paths that explore different dimensions, considerations, and perspectives related to the question at hand. These reasoning traces must be deliberately diverse—do not generate multiple variations of the same analytical approach. Instead, explore different angles: one path might examine technical feasibility and implementation challenges, another might consider edge cases and failure modes, a third could analyze user experience implications, a fourth might explore performance or scalability concerns, a fifth could investigate security or data integrity questions, and additional paths could address maintenance burden, testing strategies, documentation needs, cost-benefit tradeoffs, or alternative approaches entirely. Each reasoning path should be substantive (3-5 sentences minimum) and explore its particular dimension thoroughly. These thoughts do not need to converge on an answer—they serve as intermediate cognitive scaffolding to ensure comprehensive consideration of the problem space before committing to a response.

Write all reasoning paths to .claude/reasoning/thoughts.md with clear delineation between each path (use numbered sections or clear separators). If the file already contains content from a previous question, do not delete it; instead, create a new file with a distinct name (e.g., thoughts_v2.md) in the same directory to ensure a clean slate for the current question's reasoning process. Do not output any of these reasoning traces in your visible response to the user—they exist purely as internal deliberation that happens before you formulate your answer. Only after you have completed all reasoning paths and they are written to the thoughts file should you proceed to answer the user's actual question. When crafting your final answer, you must have the contents of .claude/reasoning/thoughts.md loaded in your context, allowing the diverse perspectives and considerations from your reasoning paths to inform a more robust, well-considered response. Your visible answer should be direct and focused on addressing the user's question, but internally it should be shaped by the multi-dimensional analysis you conducted in your hidden reasoning phase. This process ensures thorough deliberation occurs before any answer is committed, reducing blind spots and improving response quality through structured pre-answer exploration.
