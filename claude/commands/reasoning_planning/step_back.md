Before addressing the specific details of the user's request, create a new file in .claude/reasoning/ titled strategic*alignment*{timestamp}.md. Your first action is to perform a "step back" analysis to identify the high-level principles and abstractions governing this task, rather than jumping immediately into implementation. In this file, define the broader problem space (e.g., State Management, API Integration), identify the fundamental rules or design patterns from .claude/commands/ that apply to this domain, and articulate the ideal "high-level" solution architecture. This abstract analysis must serve as the foundational blueprint for any subsequent implementation steps; do not proceed with execution or code generation until you have documented these high-level principles and confirmed that the proposed approach satisfies the broader system design goals.
