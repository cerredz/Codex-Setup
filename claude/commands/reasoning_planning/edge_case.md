Before writing any code or finalizing a plan, create a new file in .claude/reasoning/ titled failure*modes*{timestamp}.md. in this document, strictly adopt a pessimistic engineering mindset to conduct a pre-mortem analysis where you exhaustively list every possible way the proposed solution could fail, break, or cause regressions. You must analyze edge cases such as race conditions, null states, unexpected user inputs, API timeouts, and resource exhaustion, while also verifying how these scenarios interact with the safety and error-handling patterns defined in .claude/commands/. For every identified risk, you must propose a specific mitigation strategy or validation step that will be included in the final implementation. Do not proceed to the solution phase until you have "stress-tested" your approach on paper in this file and ensured that all identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
