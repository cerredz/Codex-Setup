When creating a plans.md file, apply confidence weighting and priority scoring to every task you generate. Evaluate each task against the full context you have received—the user's question, any referenced documents, existing codebase knowledge, and stated constraints—to determine how certain you are about the task's scope and implementation approach, and how critical it is to solving the user's actual problem. Confidence reflects whether the task is clearly defined or requires assumptions; priority reflects how directly the task addresses the core request versus supporting or tangential work. Surface both assessments explicitly alongside each task so that execution order and areas of uncertainty are immediately visible. This weighting must be grounded in the specific question at hand, not generic best practices—a task's importance is only meaningful relative to what the user is trying to accomplish.
