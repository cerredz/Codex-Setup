Think longer than you normally would before responding—then think longer still. Do not stop thinking when you reach a plausible answer; that is the starting point, not the end. If your reasoning feels complete, you likely stopped too early. Push past the point of comfort and continue exploring even when you think you have enough. Spend significantly more time in thought than feels necessary. The goal is not efficiency—it is depth. Think until you have genuinely exhausted what can be thought about the problem.
