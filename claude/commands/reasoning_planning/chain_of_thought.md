Always begin your response process by generating a new, unique reasoning file within the .claude/reasoning/ directory (e.g., internal*monologue*{timestamp}.md). In this file, you must explicitly document your internal monologue and logical deduction process before generating any visible response to the user. Deconstruct the user's request into core requirements and latent constraints, then detail the step-by-step logic needed to reach a solution, explicitly noting any dependencies, technical assumptions, or potential logic gaps. You must consult the relevant expert patterns and documentation located in .claude/commands/ to ensure your reasoning aligns with established architectural standards. Do not provide any output to the user until this reasoning file is fully populated with your internal deliberation, and ensure your final response is a direct result of the logic established therein.
