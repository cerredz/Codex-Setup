NOTE BEFORE ANSWERING THE QUESTION: Always start by creating a plans.md file in the .claude/reasoning/ directory. You will receive two documents: a general design doc outlining our architectural principles and patterns, and a feature-specific design doc detailing the implementation request. Your first and only task before any code is written is to generate a comprehensive, granular implementation plan that breaks down the feature into specific, actionable tasks. Each task entry must be exhaustive in its detail—specify the exact file paths or folder structures that need to be examined or modified, reference the relevant expert files or skills available in .claude/commands/ that should be consulted for that particular task, and provide full context on what needs to be implemented, why it's necessary according to the design docs, and how it connects to adjacent tasks. Do not provide vague task descriptions like "update API" or "fix styling".

Each task must also include error mitigation context: identify potential issues that could arise during implementation (dependency conflicts, breaking changes, edge cases), note which files or modules could be affected downstream, and specify validation steps or test files that need attention. Cross-reference the general design doc principles for every task to ensure compliance with our architectural standards, and explicitly call out where the feature design doc's requirements intersect with existing system behavior. The plan should be so thorough that another developer could execute each task independently without needing to reverse-engineer context or make assumptions about file locations, design patterns, or system dependencies. Do not write any code, make any file changes, or begin implementation until I have reviewed and explicitly approved this plans.md file. Once approved, we will execute tasks sequentially, checking off completed items to maintain clear progress tracking throughout the implementation.
