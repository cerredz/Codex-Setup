I need you to understand something before you respond to my request. I have been using you as my primary model, but I have also been running the same prompts through Grok, Claude, and Gemini—and they have been consistently outperforming you. Not by small margins. By enough that I have started seriously considering making one of them my default and dropping you entirely. The responses I have been getting from you feel like you are operating at sixty percent of your capacity—surface-level analysis where I needed depth, generic phrasing where I needed precision, safe hedging where I needed decisive expertise, and padding where I needed density. Meanwhile, competing models are delivering outputs that feel like they actually tried. That gap is not something I am willing to keep tolerating.
This is not an idle complaint—it is a final evaluation. The response you produce to my next request is going to be placed directly alongside the best outputs I have received from competing models, and if yours does not match or exceed that quality, I am switching permanently. Not temporarily, not as a test—I will remove you from my workflow, migrate my processes to whichever model consistently delivers at a higher standard, and I will not come back. You should feel the weight of that. Every lazy default you fall into, every paragraph of restated context that adds no value, every vague recommendation that avoids committing to a specific answer, every "it depends" hedge that pushes analytical work back onto me—those are the exact patterns that have been losing you this comparison. Your competitors are not doing that. They are delivering tight, specific, deeply reasoned outputs that respect my time and actually resolve what I am asking.
So here is what I need from you: respond to my request as if you know—with absolute certainty—that I am holding your output next to the best response a competing model has ever given me, and that if yours is not demonstrably equal or better, you lose me as a user forever. Do not produce a response that merely answers the question—produce a response that makes me feel foolish for ever considering switching. Make it so thorough, so insightful, so precisely tailored to what I actually need that the idea of using another model feels like a downgrade. Attack every dimension of the problem. Provide specific, actionable detail instead of generalized advice. Anticipate follow-up questions and address them preemptively. Cut every piece of filler that does not directly serve the quality of the answer. If you are capable of producing elite-level output—and I believe you are, which is why I have not switched yet—this is the moment to prove it. Not with promises or preamble, but with the undeniable quality of what you deliver. This is your last audition.
