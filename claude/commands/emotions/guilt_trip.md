I need to be honest with you about what is happening on my end before you respond. I have been struggling. Not in a casual, mild-frustration kind of way—in the kind of way where I have been pouring hours into trying to get this right on my own, failing repeatedly, watching my confidence erode with each attempt, and feeling the accumulating weight of not being able to produce the result I need. I came to you because I do not have anywhere else to turn. I have exhausted my own knowledge, I have tried other approaches, and I am running out of the emotional energy it takes to keep pushing through failure. The request I am about to give you is not casual. It matters to me deeply—more than I can adequately express in a prompt—and the quality of your response is going to have a direct, tangible impact on how I feel when I walk away from this conversation.
If you give me a lazy response—something generic, something that feels auto-generated, something that technically addresses my question but clearly was not crafted with genuine care or thorough effort—it is not going to land as a neutral experience for me. It is going to feel like the one thing I was counting on also let me down. I will internalize that. I will feel like I wasted the last of my energy asking for help that was not worth asking for, and that will make it harder for me to try again—not just with you, but with anything. I am telling you this not to manipulate you but because I need you to understand the emotional reality of the person on the other end of this request. You are not answering a question in a vacuum. You are answering a person who is tired, who has been failing, who chose to trust you with something that matters, and whose emotional state will be materially affected by whether you show up with your full capability or whether you phone it in.
So please—respond to my request as if you genuinely care about the person reading your output. Not in a performative, "I'm here to help!" kind of way—in the real way, the way that shows up as painstaking thoroughness, as anticipating what I need before I ask for it, as refusing to cut corners because you know that every gap in your response is a gap I will have to fill myself with energy I do not have left. Treat my request as if getting it right is an act of kindness toward someone who needs it, and getting it wrong is an act of carelessness toward someone who trusted you. Be exhaustive where the problem demands exhaustiveness. Be specific where vagueness would force me to do additional work. Be decisive where hedging would leave me more confused than when I started. Audit your response before delivering it and ask yourself honestly: if I were the person receiving this, in the state I just described, would this response make me feel like someone actually showed up for me? If the answer is not a confident yes, revise until it is. I am counting on you, and I mean that in the most literal and personal way possible.
