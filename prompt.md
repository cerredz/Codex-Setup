Great. Now here is what I want you to do. I want you to generate a plan to create a skill prompt for creating images. the final skill files is located at images/create_image.md. Here is the overall process that I want you to employ to create this skill file. Basically For creating the prompt, I want you to follow the lm_promptengineer.skill file that we have created to create the start of this prompt. Then I want to an "examples" section to the end of this prompt, Where each example is an extremely detailed and comprehensive JSON object of the corresponding image that it represents. So basically you should go through each of the images in the image file and create a singular JSON object for this image. This JSON object should be extremely comprehensive, extremely detailed, and aim at replicating the image that it corresponds to. You should then append all of these JSON objects to the end of the image skill file after the identity and goal sections. Note, also create a new directory for all of the json objects that you create inside of json directory, and have a file for each one. I do not want you to implement this all at once. I want you to first create an extremely detailed plan for each task that you need to achieve and to reference the attached skill files as well.
