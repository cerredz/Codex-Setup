claude/: This folder is where all of the skills/prompts/scripts/reasoning outputs will live

claude/commands: Skill files, there are also subfolders to organize the type of skill files that we have

claude/reasoning and claude/reports: This is the location for either reasoning skill outputs or report skill outputs. 



First script that I want to create:
